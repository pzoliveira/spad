**Network Model** created in March 15th 2022 by *Pericles Zapata de Oliveira*

### Important to notice that this application can evolve as below:
  * Check if the resources (ports, nodes and links) really exist
  * Verify if the resources are available or not
  * Define the speed of the ports, links and circuits
  * Create a tool that automates the creation of links and circuits (from a source port of a node to a sink port of another node)
  * Create more complex networks (rings, mesh, bilinear, ...)
  * Define status of links and/or circuits (down, maintenance, implemented, running, redundant, standby ...)
  * Manage users privileges (read-only, read-write, commissioner ...)
  * Create a command line interface in order to create new entities and attach these entities to some network
